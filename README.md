# Restaurant-Booking-System
In this project both admin and client portal are prepared in which users can book tables, buy premium plans and also after completion of bookings they can give their valuable feedbacks on the portal itself. On the other hand admin can list any new thing or change anything from his/her side which is clearly handled by this system.
